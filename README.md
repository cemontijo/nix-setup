Linux/Unix setup, config, and customization files for bash, vim, ksh, etc.

## SETUP/INSTALLATION:
To setup and use, move all desired files to your $HOME directory.
This setup assumes the login shell is ksh. After logging in with ksh, it will run an interactive bash shell.

## Vim setup: 
This includes a customized .vimrc file that uses the plugins in .gitmodules.
Uses the Vundle plugin manager with several plugins already installed (see .gitmodules). Plugins can be managed and turned off easily with Vundle.
NOTE: I removed the .git directories from the plugins so the entire repo can be downloaded and work "out of the box"
